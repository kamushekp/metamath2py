\section{Conclusion and Further Work}
\hspace{\parindent}
Our work aims to make the high-quality formal content of Metamath more accessible for use with modern large language models. By creating the Metamath2Py dataset, we preserve the rigor of proof verification while translating theorem statements and proofs into a format better suited for pretraining, finetuning, and other machine learning applications.

Future plans include leveraging this dataset to assist human theorem provers as well as  
developing fully automated theorem proving-covering the entire pipeline from natural language theorem
formulation to formal proof writing in a system like Metamath.  

The results of our work will be published as a dataset on Hugging Face (\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/kamushekp/Metamath2Py}{link}) and as open-source code on GitHub (\href{https://github.com/kamushekp/metamath2py}{link}), both
under the MIT license.
