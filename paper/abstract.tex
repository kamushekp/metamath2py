\hspace{\parindent} Formal mathematics systems represent mathematical theorems and their proofs as logical sequences, where each
hypothesis and proof step is explicitly defined.
Adding a new theorem or proof to such a system requires both substantial manual work and deep mathematical understanding.
 However, datasets consisting of pre-existing theorems and proofs can be leveraged to build automation tools using machine learning algorithms.

We have created the Metamath2Py dataset based on the formal system Metamath \cite{metamath}, converting its
statements and proofs into executable Python constructs. This dataset can be beneficial both for fine-tuning language
models and for prompt-based applications.
